# Impact-based forecasting for the coastal zone: east coast lows

Notebooks and scripts for the Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC
_Impact-based forecasting for the coastal zone project: east coast
lows_.

The aim of the project is to develop a pilot capability to make useful
predictions of community impacts of extreme weather in coastal regions
with the goal of improving timely mitigating actions by a wide range
of stakeholders. This pilot project will focus on East Coast Low
events that often severely impact the subtropical east coast of
Australia, producing a range of hazards that are relevant to the
coastal zone, such as high wind, rain, hail, flooding and coastal
surge and erosion.

The project is a collaborative project between Geoscience Australia
and the Bureau of Meteorology.
